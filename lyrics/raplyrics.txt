Hotline Bling Lyrics
You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Yeah

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city…

Holy Grail Lyrics
You'd take the clothes off my back and I'd let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth and I'd watch you eat it
I still don’t know why
Why I love it so much (Thanks for warning me)
Oh (Thanks for warning me)
You curse my name in spite to put me to shame
Hang my laundry in the streets, dirty or clean, give it up for fame
But I still don't know why
Why I love it so much (Thanks for warning me)
Yeah (Thanks for warning me)

And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud
The next day, you're so cold
One day, you're here, one day, you're there
One day, you care, you're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail
Uh, uh, uh
Blue told me remind you niggas, uh
Fuck that shit y'all talkin' 'bout, I'm the nigga, uh
Caught up in all these lights and cameras, uh
But look what that shit did to Hammer, uh
Goddamn it, I like it
Bright lights is enticin'
But look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night
Thirty mil' for one fight
But soon as all that money blows
All the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheatin' on me
What I do? I took her back
Fool me twice, that's my bad
I can't even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder
Momma, please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame
Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself, uh

And we all just entertainers
And we're stupid and contagious
No, we all just entertainers
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud
The next day, you're so cold
One day, you're here, one day, you're there
One day, you care, you're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail
Now I got tattoos on my body
Psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper
Photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See 'em by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough, I'm callin' this off
Who the fuck I'm kiddin' though?
I'm gettin' high, sittin' low
Slidin' by in that big body
Curtains all in my window
This fame hurt, but this chain worse
I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga, deal with, this shit ain't work
This light work, camera snappin', my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and the IRS
Get the hell up off your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for, dry yours
Why you mad? Take the good with the bad
Or throw the baby out with that bath water
You still alive, still that nigga
Nigga, you survived, you still gettin' bigger
Nigga, living the life, vanilla wafers in a villa
Illest nigga alive; Michael Jackson's Thriller

And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)
I just can't crack your code (Uh, uh, uh)
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud (Uh, uh, uh)
The next day, you're so cold (Uh, uh, uh)
One day, you're here (Uh), one day, you're there
One day, you care (Uh), you're so unfair (Uh, uh)
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail

You get the air out my lungs whenever you need it
And you take the blade right out my heart
Just so you can watch me bleed
And I still don't know why (Don't know why)
Why I love you so much (Thanks for warning me)
Yeah (Thanks for warning me)
And you play this game in spite to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve
Forever in ink with guess whose name?
But I still don't know why
Why our love is so much (Thanks for warning me)
Yeah (Thanks for warning me)

And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
I just can't crack your code (Uh)
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)
The next day, you're so cold (Uh)
One day, you're here, one day, you're there (Uh, uh)

Niggas in Paris Lyrics
We're gonna skate to one song, one song only
Ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
So I ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
But first niggas gotta find me
What's fifty grand to a motherfucker like me? Can you please remind me?
(Ball so hard) This shit crazy
Y'all don't know that don't shit faze me
The Nets could go 0 for 82
And I'd look at you like this shit gravy
(Ball so hard) This shit weird
We ain't even 'posed to be here
(Ball so hard) Since we here
It's only right that we'd be fair
Psycho, I'm liable to go Michael, take your pick
Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
(Ball so hard) Got a broke clock
Rollies that don't tick-tock
Audemars that's losing time
Hidden behind all these big rocks
(B-ball so hard) I'm shocked too
I'm supposed to be locked up too
You escaped what I escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
(B-ball so hard) Let's get faded
Le Meurice for like six days
Gold bottles, scold models
Spillin' Ace on my sick J's
(Ball so hard) Bitch, behave
Just might let you meet Ye
Chi-Town's D. Rose
I'm moving the Nets, BK
Ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray
B-ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray

She said, "Ye, can we get married at the mall?"
I said, "Look, you need to crawl 'fore you ball"
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all
(Ball so hard) That shit cray, ain't it, Jay?
(B-ball so hard) What she order, fish fillet?
(B-ball so hard) Your whip so cold, this old thing?
(Ball so hard) Act like you'll ever be around motherfuckers like this again
Bougie girl, grab her hand
Fuck that bitch, she don't wanna dance
Excuse my French, but I'm in France, ahah, I'm just sayin'
Prince Williams ain't do it right, if you ask me
'Cause I was him, I would have married Kate and Ashley
What's Gucci, my nigga? What's Louis, my killer?
What's drugs, my dealer? What's that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I'm the illest 'cause I'm suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris and they going gorillas, huh
I don't even know what that means
No one knows what it means, but it's provocative
No, it's not, it's gross
Gets the people going
Ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
B-ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me

You are now watching the throne
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
These other niggas is lyin'
Actin' like the summer ain't mine
(I got that hot bitch in my home)
You know how many hot bitches I own?
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
The stars is in the building
They hands is to the ceiling
I know I'm 'bout to kill it
How you know? I got that feeling
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone
(I'm definitely in my zone)

Swimming Pools (Drank) Lyrics
Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)

Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
Lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it
Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)
Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me
Then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down
I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted
As soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently, I'm over-influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it
Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)

I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch

(Pool full of Kendrick's lies in it)
Aw man… where is she takin' me?
Where is she takin' me?
(Pool full of liquor, I'ma die in it)

All I, All I, All I, All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me
Makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough
They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-Dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
That nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin'
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'ma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in ****'s lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there
We gon' pop that bitch too
Wait hold up, ayy, I see somebody
Aha! Got them niggas, K-Dot, you good?
L****, you good?
Yeah, blood, I'm good – Dave, you good?
Dave? Dave, say somethin' – Dave?
These bitch-ass niggas killed my brother!975Embed

Godzilla Lyrics
Ugh, you're a monster

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby "The
Brain" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on a guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull a—
Man, stop
Look what I'm plannin', haha1.2KEmbed

Lose Yourself Lyrics
Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

You can do anything you set your mind to, man1.5KEmbed

Hotline Bling Lyrics
You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Yeah

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city…

Holy Grail Lyrics
You'd take the clothes off my back and I'd let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth and I'd watch you eat it
I still don’t know why
Why I love it so much (Thanks for warning me)
Oh (Thanks for warning me)
You curse my name in spite to put me to shame
Hang my laundry in the streets, dirty or clean, give it up for fame
But I still don't know why
Why I love it so much (Thanks for warning me)
Yeah (Thanks for warning me)

And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud
The next day, you're so cold
One day, you're here, one day, you're there
One day, you care, you're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail
Uh, uh, uh
Blue told me remind you niggas, uh
Fuck that shit y'all talkin' 'bout, I'm the nigga, uh
Caught up in all these lights and cameras, uh
But look what that shit did to Hammer, uh
Goddamn it, I like it
Bright lights is enticin'
But look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night
Thirty mil' for one fight
But soon as all that money blows
All the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheatin' on me
What I do? I took her back
Fool me twice, that's my bad
I can't even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder
Momma, please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame
Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself, uh

And we all just entertainers
And we're stupid and contagious
No, we all just entertainers
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud
The next day, you're so cold
One day, you're here, one day, you're there
One day, you care, you're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail
Now I got tattoos on my body
Psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper
Photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See 'em by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough, I'm callin' this off
Who the fuck I'm kiddin' though?
I'm gettin' high, sittin' low
Slidin' by in that big body
Curtains all in my window
This fame hurt, but this chain worse
I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga, deal with, this shit ain't work
This light work, camera snappin', my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and the IRS
Get the hell up off your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for, dry yours
Why you mad? Take the good with the bad
Or throw the baby out with that bath water
You still alive, still that nigga
Nigga, you survived, you still gettin' bigger
Nigga, living the life, vanilla wafers in a villa
Illest nigga alive; Michael Jackson's Thriller

And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)
I just can't crack your code (Uh, uh, uh)
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud (Uh, uh, uh)
The next day, you're so cold (Uh, uh, uh)
One day, you're here (Uh), one day, you're there
One day, you care (Uh), you're so unfair (Uh, uh)
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail

You get the air out my lungs whenever you need it
And you take the blade right out my heart
Just so you can watch me bleed
And I still don't know why (Don't know why)
Why I love you so much (Thanks for warning me)
Yeah (Thanks for warning me)
And you play this game in spite to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve
Forever in ink with guess whose name?
But I still don't know why
Why our love is so much (Thanks for warning me)
Yeah (Thanks for warning me)

And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
I just can't crack your code (Uh)
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)
The next day, you're so cold (Uh)
One day, you're here, one day, you're there (Uh, uh)
One day, you care, you're so unfair (Uh, uh, uh)
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail

(Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy grail)
(Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy grail)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Niggas in Paris Lyrics
We're gonna skate to one song, one song only
Ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
So I ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
But first niggas gotta find me
What's fifty grand to a motherfucker like me? Can you please remind me?
(Ball so hard) This shit crazy
Y'all don't know that don't shit faze me
The Nets could go 0 for 82
And I'd look at you like this shit gravy
(Ball so hard) This shit weird
We ain't even 'posed to be here
(Ball so hard) Since we here
It's only right that we'd be fair
Psycho, I'm liable to go Michael, take your pick
Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
(Ball so hard) Got a broke clock
Rollies that don't tick-tock
Audemars that's losing time
Hidden behind all these big rocks
(B-ball so hard) I'm shocked too
I'm supposed to be locked up too
You escaped what I escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
(B-ball so hard) Let's get faded
Le Meurice for like six days
Gold bottles, scold models
Spillin' Ace on my sick J's
(Ball so hard) Bitch, behave
Just might let you meet Ye
Chi-Town's D. Rose
I'm moving the Nets, BK
Ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray
B-ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray

She said, "Ye, can we get married at the mall?"
I said, "Look, you need to crawl 'fore you ball"
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all
(Ball so hard) That shit cray, ain't it, Jay?
(B-ball so hard) What she order, fish fillet?
(B-ball so hard) Your whip so cold, this old thing?
(Ball so hard) Act like you'll ever be around motherfuckers like this again
Bougie girl, grab her hand
Fuck that bitch, she don't wanna dance
Excuse my French, but I'm in France, ahah, I'm just sayin'
Prince Williams ain't do it right, if you ask me
'Cause I was him, I would have married Kate and Ashley
What's Gucci, my nigga? What's Louis, my killer?
What's drugs, my dealer? What's that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I'm the illest 'cause I'm suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris and they going gorillas, huh
I don't even know what that means
No one knows what it means, but it's provocative
No, it's not, it's gross
Gets the people going
Ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
B-ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me

You are now watching the throne
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
These other niggas is lyin'
Actin' like the summer ain't mine
(I got that hot bitch in my home)
You know how many hot bitches I own?
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
The stars is in the building
They hands is to the ceiling
I know I'm 'bout to kill it
How you know? I got that feeling
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone
(I'm definitely in my zone)

Swimming Pools (Drank) Lyrics
Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)

Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
Lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it
Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)
Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me
Then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down
I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted
As soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently, I'm over-influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?

Aw man… where is she takin' me?
Where is she takin' me?
(Pool full of liquor, I'ma die in it)

All I, All I, All I, All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me
Makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up

Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off

Yeah, blood, I'm good – Dave, you good?
Dave? Dave, say somethin' – Dave?

Ugh, you're a monster

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby "The
Brain" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on a guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull a—
Man, stop
Look what I'm plannin', haha1.2KEmbed

Lose Yourself Lyrics
Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

You can do anything you set your mind to, man1.5KEmbed

My emo bitch like her wrist slit
Curly hair bitch like I'm Corbin
Got like three bitches, I'm Mormon
Skeet on your main bitch's forehead
Don't want your pussy, just want head

Look at me, fuck on me

Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, yah, ayy!
Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, fuck on me

Hotline Bling Lyrics
You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Yeah

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city…

Holy Grail Lyrics
You'd take the clothes off my back and I'd let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth and I'd watch you eat it
I still don’t know why
Why I love it so much (Thanks for warning me)
Oh (Thanks for warning me)
You curse my name in spite to put me to shame
Hang my laundry in the streets, dirty or clean, give it up for fame
But I still don't know why
Why I love it so much (Thanks for warning me)
Yeah (Thanks for warning me)

And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud
The next day, you're so cold
One day, you're here, one day, you're there
One day, you care, you're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail
Uh, uh, uh
Blue told me remind you niggas, uh
Fuck that shit y'all talkin' 'bout, I'm the nigga, uh
Caught up in all these lights and cameras, uh
But look what that shit did to Hammer, uh
Goddamn it, I like it
Bright lights is enticin'
But look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night
Thirty mil' for one fight
But soon as all that money blows
All the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheatin' on me
What I do? I took her back
Fool me twice, that's my bad
I can't even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder
Momma, please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame
Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself, uh

And we all just entertainers
And we're stupid and contagious
No, we all just entertainers
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud
The next day, you're so cold
One day, you're here, one day, you're there
One day, you care, you're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail
Now I got tattoos on my body
Psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper
Photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See 'em by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough, I'm callin' this off
Who the fuck I'm kiddin' though?
I'm gettin' high, sittin' low
Slidin' by in that big body
Curtains all in my window
This fame hurt, but this chain worse
I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga, deal with, this shit ain't work
This light work, camera snappin', my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and the IRS
Get the hell up off your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for, dry yours
Why you mad? Take the good with the bad
Or throw the baby out with that bath water
You still alive, still that nigga
Nigga, you survived, you still gettin' bigger
Nigga, living the life, vanilla wafers in a villa
Illest nigga alive; Michael Jackson's Thriller

And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)
I just can't crack your code (Uh, uh, uh)
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud (Uh, uh, uh)
The next day, you're so cold (Uh, uh, uh)
One day, you're here (Uh), one day, you're there
One day, you care (Uh), you're so unfair (Uh, uh)
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail

You get the air out my lungs whenever you need it
And you take the blade right out my heart
Just so you can watch me bleed
And I still don't know why (Don't know why)
Why I love you so much (Thanks for warning me)
Yeah (Thanks for warning me)
And you play this game in spite to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve
Forever in ink with guess whose name?
But I still don't know why
Why our love is so much (Thanks for warning me)
Yeah (Thanks for warning me)

And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
I just can't crack your code (Uh)
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)
The next day, you're so cold (Uh)
One day, you're here, one day, you're there (Uh, uh)
One day, you care, you're so unfair (Uh, uh, uh)
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail

(Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy grail)
(Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy grail)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Niggas in Paris Lyrics
We're gonna skate to one song, one song only
Ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
So I ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
But first niggas gotta find me
What's fifty grand to a motherfucker like me? Can you please remind me?
(Ball so hard) This shit crazy
Y'all don't know that don't shit faze me
The Nets could go 0 for 82
And I'd look at you like this shit gravy
(Ball so hard) This shit weird
We ain't even 'posed to be here
(Ball so hard) Since we here
It's only right that we'd be fair
Psycho, I'm liable to go Michael, take your pick
Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
(Ball so hard) Got a broke clock
Rollies that don't tick-tock
Audemars that's losing time
Hidden behind all these big rocks
(B-ball so hard) I'm shocked too
I'm supposed to be locked up too
You escaped what I escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
(B-ball so hard) Let's get faded
Le Meurice for like six days
Gold bottles, scold models
Spillin' Ace on my sick J's
(Ball so hard) Bitch, behave
Just might let you meet Ye
Chi-Town's D. Rose
I'm moving the Nets, BK
Ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray
B-ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray

She said, "Ye, can we get married at the mall?"
I said, "Look, you need to crawl 'fore you ball"
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all
(Ball so hard) That shit cray, ain't it, Jay?
(B-ball so hard) What she order, fish fillet?
(B-ball so hard) Your whip so cold, this old thing?
(Ball so hard) Act like you'll ever be around motherfuckers like this again
Bougie girl, grab her hand
Fuck that bitch, she don't wanna dance
Excuse my French, but I'm in France, ahah, I'm just sayin'
Prince Williams ain't do it right, if you ask me
'Cause I was him, I would have married Kate and Ashley
What's Gucci, my nigga? What's Louis, my killer?
What's drugs, my dealer? What's that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I'm the illest 'cause I'm suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris and they going gorillas, huh
I don't even know what that means
No one knows what it means, but it's provocative
No, it's not, it's gross
Gets the people going
Ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
B-ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me

You are now watching the throne
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
These other niggas is lyin'
Actin' like the summer ain't mine
(I got that hot bitch in my home)
You know how many hot bitches I own?
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
The stars is in the building
They hands is to the ceiling
I know I'm 'bout to kill it
How you know? I got that feeling
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone
(I'm definitely in my zone)

Swimming Pools (Drank) Lyrics
Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)

Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
Lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it
Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)
Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me
Then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down
I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted
As soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently, I'm over-influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it
Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)

I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it
Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)
(Pool full of Kendrick's lies in it)
Aw man… where is she takin' me?
Where is she takin' me?
(Pool full of liquor, I'ma die in it)

All I, All I, All I, All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me
Makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough
They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-Dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
That nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin'
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'ma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in ****'s lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there
We gon' pop that bitch too
Wait hold up, ayy, I see somebody
Aha! Got them niggas, K-Dot, you good?
L****, you good?
Yeah, blood, I'm good – Dave, you good?
Dave? Dave, say somethin' – Dave?
These bitch-ass niggas killed my brother!975Embed

Godzilla Lyrics
Ugh, you're a monster

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby "The
Brain" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on a guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull a—
Man, stop
Look what I'm plannin', haha1.2KEmbed

Lose Yourself Lyrics
Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

You can do anything you set your mind to, man1.5KEmbed

Got like three bitches, I'm Mormon
Skeet on your main bitch's forehead
Don't want your pussy, just want head

Look at me, fuck on me

Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, yah, ayy!
Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, fuck on me

DNA. Lyrics
I got, I got, I got, I got—
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain, and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle, though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that’s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (I’m a soldier's DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages
Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA

Hotline Bling Lyrics
You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Yeah

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city…

Holy Grail Lyrics
You'd take the clothes off my back and I'd let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth and I'd watch you eat it
I still don’t know why
Why I love it so much (Thanks for warning me)
Oh (Thanks for warning me)
You curse my name in spite to put me to shame
Hang my laundry in the streets, dirty or clean, give it up for fame
But I still don't know why
Why I love it so much (Thanks for warning me)
Yeah (Thanks for warning me)

And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud
The next day, you're so cold
One day, you're here, one day, you're there
One day, you care, you're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail
Uh, uh, uh
Blue told me remind you niggas, uh
Fuck that shit y'all talkin' 'bout, I'm the nigga, uh
Caught up in all these lights and cameras, uh
But look what that shit did to Hammer, uh
Goddamn it, I like it
Bright lights is enticin'
But look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night
Thirty mil' for one fight
But soon as all that money blows
All the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheatin' on me
What I do? I took her back
Fool me twice, that's my bad
I can't even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder
Momma, please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame
Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself, uh

And we all just entertainers
And we're stupid and contagious
No, we all just entertainers
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud
The next day, you're so cold
One day, you're here, one day, you're there
One day, you care, you're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail
Now I got tattoos on my body
Psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper
Photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See 'em by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough, I'm callin' this off
Who the fuck I'm kiddin' though?
I'm gettin' high, sittin' low
Slidin' by in that big body
Curtains all in my window
This fame hurt, but this chain worse
I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga, deal with, this shit ain't work
This light work, camera snappin', my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and the IRS
Get the hell up off your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for, dry yours
Why you mad? Take the good with the bad
Or throw the baby out with that bath water
You still alive, still that nigga
Nigga, you survived, you still gettin' bigger
Nigga, living the life, vanilla wafers in a villa
Illest nigga alive; Michael Jackson's Thriller

And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)
I just can't crack your code (Uh, uh, uh)
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud (Uh, uh, uh)
The next day, you're so cold (Uh, uh, uh)
One day, you're here (Uh), one day, you're there
One day, you care (Uh), you're so unfair (Uh, uh)
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail

You get the air out my lungs whenever you need it
And you take the blade right out my heart
Just so you can watch me bleed
And I still don't know why (Don't know why)
Why I love you so much (Thanks for warning me)
Yeah (Thanks for warning me)
And you play this game in spite to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve
Forever in ink with guess whose name?
But I still don't know why
Why our love is so much (Thanks for warning me)
Yeah (Thanks for warning me)

And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
I just can't crack your code (Uh)
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)
The next day, you're so cold (Uh)
One day, you're here, one day, you're there (Uh, uh)
One day, you care, you're so unfair (Uh, uh, uh)

Niggas in Paris Lyrics
We're gonna skate to one song, one song only
Ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
So I ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
But first niggas gotta find me
What's fifty grand to a motherfucker like me? Can you please remind me?
(Ball so hard) This shit crazy
Y'all don't know that don't shit faze me
The Nets could go 0 for 82
And I'd look at you like this shit gravy
(Ball so hard) This shit weird
We ain't even 'posed to be here
(Ball so hard) Since we here
It's only right that we'd be fair
Psycho, I'm liable to go Michael, take your pick
Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
(Ball so hard) Got a broke clock
Rollies that don't tick-tock
Audemars that's losing time
Hidden behind all these big rocks
(B-ball so hard) I'm shocked too
I'm supposed to be locked up too
You escaped what I escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
(B-ball so hard) Let's get faded
Le Meurice for like six days
Gold bottles, scold models
Spillin' Ace on my sick J's
(Ball so hard) Bitch, behave
Just might let you meet Ye
Chi-Town's D. Rose
I'm moving the Nets, BK
Ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray
B-ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray

She said, "Ye, can we get married at the mall?"
I said, "Look, you need to crawl 'fore you ball"
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all
(Ball so hard) That shit cray, ain't it, Jay?
(B-ball so hard) What she order, fish fillet?
(B-ball so hard) Your whip so cold, this old thing?
(Ball so hard) Act like you'll ever be around motherfuckers like this again
Bougie girl, grab her hand
Fuck that bitch, she don't wanna dance
Excuse my French, but I'm in France, ahah, I'm just sayin'
Prince Williams ain't do it right, if you ask me
'Cause I was him, I would have married Kate and Ashley
What's Gucci, my nigga? What's Louis, my killer?
What's drugs, my dealer? What's that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I'm the illest 'cause I'm suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris and they going gorillas, huh
I don't even know what that means
No one knows what it means, but it's provocative
No, it's not, it's gross
Gets the people going
Ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
B-ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me

You are now watching the throne
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
These other niggas is lyin'
Actin' like the summer ain't mine
(I got that hot bitch in my home)
You know how many hot bitches I own?
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
The stars is in the building
They hands is to the ceiling
I know I'm 'bout to kill it
How you know? I got that feeling
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone
(I'm definitely in my zone)

Swimming Pools (Drank) Lyrics
Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)

Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
Lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it
Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)
Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me
Then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down
I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted
As soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently, I'm over-influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it
Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)

I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it
Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)
(Pool full of Kendrick's lies in it)
Aw man… where is she takin' me?
Where is she takin' me?
(Pool full of liquor, I'ma die in it)

All I, All I, All I, All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me
Makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough
They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-Dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
That nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin'
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'ma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in ****'s lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there
We gon' pop that bitch too
Wait hold up, ayy, I see somebody
Aha! Got them niggas, K-Dot, you good?
L****, you good?
Yeah, blood, I'm good – Dave, you good?
Dave? Dave, say somethin' – Dave?
These bitch-ass niggas killed my brother!975Embed

Godzilla Lyrics
Ugh, you're a monster

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby "The
Brain" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on a guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull a—
Man, stop
Look what I'm plannin', haha1.2KEmbed

Lose Yourself Lyrics
Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

You can do anything you set your mind to, man1.5KEmbed

My emo bitch like her wrist slit
Curly hair bitch like I'm Corbin
Got like three bitches, I'm Mormon
Skeet on your main bitch's forehead
Don't want your pussy, just want head

Look at me, fuck on me

Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, yah, ayy!
Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, fuck on me

DNA. Lyrics
I got, I got, I got, I got—
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain, and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle, though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that’s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (I’m a soldier's DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages
Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA

Money Trees Lyrics
Uh, me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish (Ya bish)
Hit the house lick: tell me, is you wit' it, ya bish? (Ya bish)
Home invasion was persuasive (Was persuasive)
From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish (Ya bish)
Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (Like rappers do)
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool (They wasn't cool)
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros (Tell my bros)
Then Usher Raymond "Let It Burn" came on ("Let Burn" came on)
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish (Ya bish)
Park the car, then we start rhymin', ya bish (Ya bish)
The only thing we had to free our mind (Free our mind)
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs (See dollar signs)
You lookin' like a easy come-up, ya bish (Ya bish)
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish (Ya bish)
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew (We never knew)
Go at a reverend for the revenue
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel

Nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
That's just how I feel

Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (Like rappers do)
Bump that new E-40 after school (Way after school)
You know, “Big Ballin' With My Homies” (My homies)
Earl Stevens had us thinkin' rational (Thinkin' rational, that's rational)
Back to reality, we poor, ya bish (Ya bish)
Another casualty at war, ya bish (Ya bish)
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head (My Tony head)
He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish (Ya bish)
That Louis Burgers never be the same (Won't be the same)
A Louis belt that never ease that pain (Won't ease that pain)
But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin' (That day is jerkin')
Pull off at Church's, with Pirellis skirtin' (Pirellis skirtin')
Gang signs out the window, ya bish (Ya bish)
Hopin' all of 'em offend you, ya bish (Ya bish)
They say your hood is a pot of gold (A pot of gold)
And we gon' crash it when nobody's home
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel

A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch

A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
That's just how I feel
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way!
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way!
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!
Imagine Rock up in them projects
Where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings
Liquors spillin', pistols poppin'
Bakin' soda YOLA whippin'
Ain't no turkey on Thanksgivin'
My homeboy just dome'd a nigga
I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue
Every day I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do
When you eatin' cheese from the government?
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em
Get the fuck up out my way, bitch
Got that drum and I got them bands
Just like a parade, bitch
Drop that work up in the bushes
Hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do, tell the truth
This the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut
Them serpents lurkin', Blood
Bitches sellin' pussy, niggas sellin' drugs
But it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch
And tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree

It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel

Kendrick’s Mom: Kendrick, just bring my car back, man. I called in for another appointment. I figured you weren’t gonna be back here on time anyways. Look, shit, shit, I just wanna get out the house, man. This man is on one, he feelin' good as a motherfucker. Shit, I’m tryna get my thing goin', too. Just bring my car back. Shit, he faded.

Hotline Bling Lyrics
You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Yeah

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city…

Holy Grail Lyrics
You'd take the clothes off my back and I'd let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth and I'd watch you eat it
I still don’t know why
Why I love it so much (Thanks for warning me)
Oh (Thanks for warning me)
You curse my name in spite to put me to shame
Hang my laundry in the streets, dirty or clean, give it up for fame
But I still don't know why
Why I love it so much (Thanks for warning me)
Yeah (Thanks for warning me)

And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud
The next day, you're so cold
One day, you're here, one day, you're there
One day, you care, you're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail
Uh, uh, uh
Blue told me remind you niggas, uh
Fuck that shit y'all talkin' 'bout, I'm the nigga, uh
Caught up in all these lights and cameras, uh
But look what that shit did to Hammer, uh
Goddamn it, I like it
Bright lights is enticin'
But look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night
Thirty mil' for one fight
But soon as all that money blows
All the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheatin' on me
What I do? I took her back
Fool me twice, that's my bad
I can't even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder
Momma, please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame
Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself, uh

And we all just entertainers
And we're stupid and contagious
No, we all just entertainers
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud
The next day, you're so cold
One day, you're here, one day, you're there
One day, you care, you're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail
Now I got tattoos on my body
Psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper
Photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See 'em by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough, I'm callin' this off
Who the fuck I'm kiddin' though?
I'm gettin' high, sittin' low
Slidin' by in that big body
Curtains all in my window
This fame hurt, but this chain worse
I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga, deal with, this shit ain't work
This light work, camera snappin', my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and the IRS
Get the hell up off your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for, dry yours
Why you mad? Take the good with the bad
Or throw the baby out with that bath water
You still alive, still that nigga
Nigga, you survived, you still gettin' bigger
Nigga, living the life, vanilla wafers in a villa
Illest nigga alive; Michael Jackson's Thriller

And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)
I just can't crack your code (Uh, uh, uh)
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud (Uh, uh, uh)
The next day, you're so cold (Uh, uh, uh)
One day, you're here (Uh), one day, you're there
One day, you care (Uh), you're so unfair (Uh, uh)
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail

You get the air out my lungs whenever you need it
And you take the blade right out my heart
Just so you can watch me bleed
And I still don't know why (Don't know why)
Why I love you so much (Thanks for warning me)
Yeah (Thanks for warning me)
And you play this game in spite to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve
Forever in ink with guess whose name?
But I still don't know why
Why our love is so much (Thanks for warning me)
Yeah (Thanks for warning me)

And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
I just can't crack your code (Uh)
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)
The next day, you're so cold (Uh)
One day, you're here, one day, you're there (Uh, uh)
One day, you care, you're so unfair (Uh, uh, uh)
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail

(Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy grail)
(Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy grail)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't know why

Niggas in Paris Lyrics
We're gonna skate to one song, one song only
Ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
So I ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
But first niggas gotta find me
What's fifty grand to a motherfucker like me? Can you please remind me?
(Ball so hard) This shit crazy
Y'all don't know that don't shit faze me
The Nets could go 0 for 82
And I'd look at you like this shit gravy
(Ball so hard) This shit weird
We ain't even 'posed to be here
(Ball so hard) Since we here
It's only right that we'd be fair
Psycho, I'm liable to go Michael, take your pick
Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
(Ball so hard) Got a broke clock
Rollies that don't tick-tock
Audemars that's losing time
Hidden behind all these big rocks
(B-ball so hard) I'm shocked too
I'm supposed to be locked up too
You escaped what I escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
(B-ball so hard) Let's get faded
Le Meurice for like six days
Gold bottles, scold models
Spillin' Ace on my sick J's
(Ball so hard) Bitch, behave
Just might let you meet Ye
Chi-Town's D. Rose
I'm moving the Nets, BK
Ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray
B-ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray

She said, "Ye, can we get married at the mall?"
I said, "Look, you need to crawl 'fore you ball"
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all
(Ball so hard) That shit cray, ain't it, Jay?
(B-ball so hard) What she order, fish fillet?
(B-ball so hard) Your whip so cold, this old thing?
(Ball so hard) Act like you'll ever be around motherfuckers like this again
Bougie girl, grab her hand
Fuck that bitch, she don't wanna dance
Excuse my French, but I'm in France, ahah, I'm just sayin'
Prince Williams ain't do it right, if you ask me
'Cause I was him, I would have married Kate and Ashley
What's Gucci, my nigga? What's Louis, my killer?
What's drugs, my dealer? What's that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I'm the illest 'cause I'm suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris and they going gorillas, huh
I don't even know what that means
No one knows what it means, but it's provocative
No, it's not, it's gross
Gets the people going
Ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
B-ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me

You are now watching the throne
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
These other niggas is lyin'
Actin' like the summer ain't mine
(I got that hot bitch in my home)
You know how many hot bitches I own?
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
The stars is in the building
They hands is to the ceiling
I know I'm 'bout to kill it
How you know? I got that feeling
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone
(I'm definitely in my zone)

Swimming Pools (Drank) Lyrics
Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)

Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
Lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it
Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)
Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me
Then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down
I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted
As soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently, I'm over-influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it
Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)

I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it
Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)
(Pool full of Kendrick's lies in it)
Aw man… where is she takin' me?
Where is she takin' me?
(Pool full of liquor, I'ma die in it)

All I, All I, All I, All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me
Makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough
They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-Dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
That nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin'
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'ma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in ****'s lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there
We gon' pop that bitch too
Wait hold up, ayy, I see somebody
Aha! Got them niggas, K-Dot, you good?
L****, you good?
Yeah, blood, I'm good – Dave, you good?
Dave? Dave, say somethin' – Dave?
These bitch-ass niggas killed my brother!975Embed

Godzilla Lyrics
Ugh, you're a monster

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby "The
Brain" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on a guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull a—
Man, stop
Look what I'm plannin', haha1.2KEmbed

Lose Yourself Lyrics
Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

You can do anything you set your mind to, man1.5KEmbed

Got like three bitches, I'm Mormon
Skeet on your main bitch's forehead
Don't want your pussy, just want head

Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, fuck on me
Look at me, fuck on me

DNA. Lyrics
I got, I got, I got, I got—
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain, and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle, though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that’s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (I’m a soldier's DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages
Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA

Money Trees Lyrics
Uh, me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish (Ya bish)
Hit the house lick: tell me, is you wit' it, ya bish? (Ya bish)
Home invasion was persuasive (Was persuasive)
From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish (Ya bish)
Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (Like rappers do)
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool (They wasn't cool)
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros (Tell my bros)
Then Usher Raymond "Let It Burn" came on ("Let Burn" came on)
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish (Ya bish)
Park the car, then we start rhymin', ya bish (Ya bish)
The only thing we had to free our mind (Free our mind)
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs (See dollar signs)
You lookin' like a easy come-up, ya bish (Ya bish)
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish (Ya bish)
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew (We never knew)
Go at a reverend for the revenue
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel

Nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
That's just how I feel

Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (Like rappers do)
Bump that new E-40 after school (Way after school)
You know, “Big Ballin' With My Homies” (My homies)
Earl Stevens had us thinkin' rational (Thinkin' rational, that's rational)
Back to reality, we poor, ya bish (Ya bish)
Another casualty at war, ya bish (Ya bish)
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head (My Tony head)
He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish (Ya bish)
That Louis Burgers never be the same (Won't be the same)
A Louis belt that never ease that pain (Won't ease that pain)
But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin' (That day is jerkin')
Pull off at Church's, with Pirellis skirtin' (Pirellis skirtin')
Gang signs out the window, ya bish (Ya bish)
Hopin' all of 'em offend you, ya bish (Ya bish)
They say your hood is a pot of gold (A pot of gold)
And we gon' crash it when nobody's home
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all day

Money trees is the perfect place for shade

Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way!
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way!
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!
Imagine Rock up in them projects
Where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings
Liquors spillin', pistols poppin'
Bakin' soda YOLA whippin'
Ain't no turkey on Thanksgivin'
My homeboy just dome'd a nigga
I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue
Every day I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do
When you eatin' cheese from the government?
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em
Get the fuck up out my way, bitch
Got that drum and I got them bands
Just like a parade, bitch
Drop that work up in the bushes
Hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do, tell the truth
This the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut
Them serpents lurkin', Blood
Bitches sellin' pussy, niggas sellin' drugs
But it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch
And tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree

It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel

Old Town Road (Remix) Lyrics
Oh, oh-oh
Oh

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more (Kio, Kio)
I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I been in the valley
You ain't been up off that porch, now
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

Ridin' on a tractor
Lean all in my bladder
Cheated on my baby
You can go and ask her
My life is a movie
Bull ridin' and boobies
Cowboy hat from Gucci
Wrangler on my booty

Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rockstar
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more336Embed

We go back, remember criss-cross and hopscotch? (Hopscotch)
You the one that hold me down when the block's hot (Hot)
I make your dreams come true when you wake up (Dream)
And your look's just the same without no make-up (Bad)
Had to pull up on your mama, see what you're made of (Mama)
Ain't gotta worry 'bout 'em commas 'cause my cake up (Cake)
You can run inside my life from that fame bus (Skrrt)
'Cause I promise, when we step out you'll be famous (Yeah)
Modern day Bonnie and Clyde what they named us (Why?)
'Cause when we pull up—brt-brt!—all angles

The money never lie, no

Okay though

Uh, she beat her face up with that new Chanel
She like the price, she see the ice, it make her coochie melt
When I met her in the club I asked her who she felt
Then she went and put that booty on that Gucci belt
We don't got no label
She say she want bottles, she ain't got no table
She don't got no bed frame, she don't got no tables
We just watchin' Netflix, she ain't got no cable, okay though
Plug, plug, plug, I'm the plug for her
She want a nigga that pull her hair and hold the door for her
Baby, that's only me, bitch, it okay with me
Baby, okay, okay though

Lookin' for the one?
Well, bitch, you're lookin' at the one
I'm the best yet, and yet my best is yet to come
'Cause I've been lookin' for somebody
Not just any fuckin' body
Don't make me catch a body
That's for any and everybody
Oh my God, she hit me up all day, get no response
Bitch, you blow my high
That's like turnin' gold to bronze, roll my eyes
And when she on the molly, she a zombie
She think we Clyde and Bonnie
But it's more like Whitney and Bobby
God, forgive me! Tunechi F finessin', I'm a legend
Straight up out the Crescent
Fly your bae down for the Essence
For the record I knew Khaled when that boy was spinnin' records
Mula Gang, winnin' record
I'm just flexin' on my exes, oh God

Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth
The money never lie, no

No Role Modelz Lyrics
First things first: rest in peace Uncle Phil
For real
You the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville
Fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King would'a been on Dreamville, talk to a nigga

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed by the baddest bitch
Not Trina but I swear to God, this bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, "Hey, what's good?
Sorry, I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good"
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, "Nah, I was the same without it"
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
'Fore I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody, you wadn't sweatin' me

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

I want a real love, dark-skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do', nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt, 'fore she leave
"I'ma need my shirt back" (Nigga, you know how it go)

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once… shame on… shame on you. Fool me—can't get fooled again.

Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop bop bop)
Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop bop bop)

My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch prolly couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song

She shallow but the pussy deep, she shallow
She shallow
She shallow but the pussy deep, she shallow (Yeah, ayy)
She shallow
She shallow but the pussy deep, she shallow
She shallow
She shallow but the pussy deep, she shallow
She shallow

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

Alexander Hamilton Lyrics
How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a
Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten
Spot in the Caribbean by providence, impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

The ten-dollar Founding Father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter
Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain

Well, the word got around, they said, “This kid is insane, man”
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
“Get your education, don’t forget from whence you came, and
The world's gonna know your name. What’s your name, man?”
Alexander Hamilton
My name is Alexander Hamilton
And there's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait, just you wait...

When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden
Half-dead sittin' in their own sick, the scent thick

And Alex got better but his mother went quick
Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin' but ruined pride, something new inside
A voice saying
“Alex, you gotta fend for yourself.”
He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf

There would have been nothin’ left to do
For someone less astute
He woulda been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution
Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord
Tradin’ sugar cane and rum and all the things he can’t afford
Scammin' for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin' for the future see him now as he stands on (ooh)
The bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man

In New York you can be a new man (Just you wait)
In New York you can be a new man (Just you wait)
In New York you can be a new man
In New York, New York
Just you wait!
Alexander Hamilton (Alexander Hamilton)
We are waiting in the wings for you (waiting in the wings for you)
You could never back down
You never learned to take your time!
Oh, Alexander Hamilton (Alexander Hamilton)
When America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh

The ship is in the harbor now
See if you can spot him
Just you wait
Another immigrant
Comin’ up from the bottom
Just you wait
His enemies destroyed his rep
America forgot him
We fought with him
Me? I died for him
Me? I trusted him
Me? I loved him
And me? I'm the damn fool that shot him

There's a million things I haven’t done
But just you wait!

What's your name, man?

America
God bless you if it's good to ya
America, please take my hand
Can you help me underst—
New Kung Fu Kenny!

Throw a steak off the ark to a pool full of sharks
He'll take it
Leave him in the wilderness with a sworn nemesis
He'll make it (He'll make it)
Take the gratitude from him, I bet he'll show you somethin'
Woah (Woah)
I chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
I chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
I chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that!," X-rated
Johnny don't wanna go to school no mo', no mo'
Johnny said books ain't cool no mo' (No mo')
Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'
God bless America, you know we all love him
Yesterday, I got a call, like, from my dog, like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done
He said: "K-Dot, can you pray for me? It been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome."
He was lookin' for some closure, hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him
"I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed."
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block
I catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that!"
Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma, touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother
You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention, call you back—
Alright, kids, we're gonna talk about gun control
(Pray for me) Damn!

It's not a place
This country is to me a sound
Of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around

Hail Mary, Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag is wrapped in drag with explosives
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders—look what you taught us
It's murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street
Corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with
Homicidal thoughts; Donald Trump's in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest, or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you Crippin' or you married to Blood?
I'll aks again—oops, accident
It's nasty when you set us up then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera
America's reflections of me, that's what a mirror does
It's not a place
This country is to me a sound
Of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look ar—240Embed

Pray the real live forever, man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari, then I swerve
I want that Bugatti, just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry, that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me, I guess I know myself
Shakiness, man, I don't have no time for that
My city too turned up, I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbaud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
Man, that was when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Man, I'm talkin' way before hashtags

You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
When you're not around
When you throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time598Embed

It’s Everyday Bro Lyrics
Yah
Y'all can't handle this
Y'all don't know what's about to happen, baby
(It's everyday bro, everyday)
Team 10
Los Angeles, Cali boy
But I'm from Ohio though, white boy

It's everyday, bro, with the Disney Channel flow
Five mil' on YouTube in six months, never done before
Passed all the competition, man, PewDiePie is next
Man, I'm poppin' all these checks, got the brand new Rolex
And it match the Lambo too, and I'm coming with the crew
This is Team 10, bitch, who the hell are flippin' you?
And you know I kick them out if they ain't with the crew
Yeah, I'm talking about you, you beggin' for attention
Talking shit on Twitter, too, but you still hit my phone last night
It was 4:52, and I got the text to prove
And all the recordings too, don't make me tell them the truth
And I just dropped some new merch, and it's selling like a god church
Ohio's where I'm from, we chew 'em like it's gum
We shooting with a gun, the tattoo just for fun
I Usain Bolt and run, catch me at game one
I cannot be outdone, Jake Paul is number one
It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
I said it's everyday bro!

You know it's Nick Crompton, and my collar stay poppin'
Yes, I can rap, and no, I'm not from Compton
England is my city
And if it weren't for Team 10, then the US would be shitty
I'll pass it to Chance, 'cause you know he stay litty

Two months ago, you didn't know my name
And now you want my fame?
Bitch I'm blowin' up, I'm only going up
Now I'm going off, I'm never fallin' off
Like Mag, who? Digi who? Who are you?
All these beefs, I just ran through, hit a milli' in a month
Where were you? Hatin' on me back in West Fake
Think you need to get your shit straight
Jakey brought me to the top, now we really poppin' off
Number one and number four, that's why these fans all at our door
It's lonely at the top, so we all going
We left Ohio, now the trio's all rollin'
It's Team 10, bitch
We back again, always first, never last
We the future, we'll see you in the past
It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
I said it's everyday bro!

Hold on, hold on, hold on (Espera)
Can we switch the language? (Ha, ya tú sabe')
We 'bout to hit it (Dale)

Sí, lo único que quiero es dinero
Trabajando en YouTube todo el día entero (Dale)
Viviendo en U.S.A, el sueño de cualquiera (Ha)
Enviando dólares a mi familia entera (Pasta)
Tenemos una persona por encima
Se llama Donald Trump y está en la cima
Desde aquí te cantamos, can I get my VISA?
Martinez Twins, representando España
Desde la pobreza a la fama

It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
I said it's everyday bro!
Yo, it's Tessa Brooks
The competition shook
These guys up on me
I got 'em with the hook
Lemme educate ya
And I ain't talking book
Panera is your home
So stop calling my phone
I'm flyin' like a drone
They buying like a loan
Yeah, I smell good
Is that your boy's cologne?

Is that your boy's cologne?
Started ballin', Quicken Loans
Now I'm in my flippin' zone
Yes, they all copy me, but
That's some shitty clones
Stay in all designer clothes
And they ask me what I make
I said, "It's ten with six zeros"
Always plug merch link in bio
And I will see you tomorrow 'cause
It's everyday bro

Back to Back Lyrics
Oh man
Oh man, oh man
Not again

Yeah
I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Woah—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith, playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean whoa, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one
I got the drink in me, going back to back
Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me, going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back

I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you saying, "Drizzy, tell 'em again!"
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you'd do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'

They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga (Six)1.3KEmbed

Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe Lyrics
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling

Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of his?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling

Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe

I'm tryin' to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me, then put me on stages
To me, that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling

Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe

Bitch, don't kill my vibe
You ain't heard the coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings, now, what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on the pedestal
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music

I say bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe

Ayy, K-Dot, get in the car, nigga!
Come on, we finna roll out!
Nigga, I got a pack of blacks and a beat CD
Get yo' freestyles ready!703Embed

Black Beatles Lyrics
Black Beatles in the city
Be back immediately to confiscate the moneys
(Ear Drummers)
Rae Sremm, Guwop, Mike WiLL!
I sent flowers, but you said you didn't receive 'em
But you said you didn't need 'em (Mike WiLL Made-It!)

That girl is a real crowd pleaser (Oh, yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (Know me)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (Ah)
Quick-release the cash, watch it fall slowly (Slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even (Get even)
Haters mad for whatever reason (Yeah, yeah)
Smoke in the air, binge drinking (Oh, oh)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (Remember)
Getting so gone I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
There is nothin' to explain
I'm a fuckin' black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal
Rockin' John Lennon lenses, like to see ‘em spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
Screamin', "Everybody's famous!"
Like clockwork, I blow it all
And get some more
Get you somebody that can do both
Black Beatles got the babes belly rollin'
She think she love me, I think she trollin'

That girl is a real crowd pleaser (Oh, yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (Know me)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (Ah)
Quick-release the cash, watch it fall slowly (Slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even (Get even)
Haters mad for whatever reason (Yeah, yeah)
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin' (Oh, oh)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (Remember)

Came in with two girls, look like strippers in their real clothes
A broke ho can only point me to a rich ho
A yellow bitch with green hair, a real weirdo
Black man, yellow Lamb', red light go
They seen that Guwop and them just came in through the side door
There's so much money on the floor we buyin' school clothes
Why you bring the money machine to the club for?
Pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo
I Eurostep past a hater like I'm Rondo
I upgrade your baby mama to a condo
Like Chapo servin' llello to the gringos
Black Beatle, club close when I say so
That girl is a real crowd pleaser (Oh, yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (Know me)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (Ah)
Quick-release the cash, watch it fall slowly (Slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even (Get even)
Haters mad for whatever reason (Yeah, yeah)
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin' (Oh, oh)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (Remember)

She's a good teaser, and we blowin' reefer
Your body like a work of art, baby
Don't fuck with me, I'll break your heart, baby
D&G on me, I got a lot of flavor
15 hundred on my feet, I'm tryna kill these haters
I had haters when I was broke, I'm rich, I still got haters
I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player
I wear leather Gucci jackets like it's still the 80s
I've been blowin' OG Kush, I feel a lil' sedated
I can't worry about a broke nigga or a hater
Black Beatle, bitch, me and Paul McCartney related

That girl is a real crowd pleaser (Oh, yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (Know me)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (Ah)
Quick-release the cash, watch it fall slowly (Slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even (Get even)
Haters mad for whatever reason (Yeah, yeah)
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin' (Oh, oh)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (Remember)223Embed

Control Lyrics

Mhm, I look up
Yeah, and I take my time, nigga
I'ma take my time, woah
Mhm, power moves only, nigga

Boy, I'm 'bout my business on business, I drink liquor on liquor
I had women on women: yeah, that's bunk-bed bitches
I've done lived more than an 80-year-old man still kickin'
‘Cause they live for some moments, and I live for a livin'
But this for the girls who barely let me get to first base
On some ground ball shit
‘Cause now I run my city on some town hall shit
They prayin' on my motherfuckin' downfall, bitch
Like a drought, but you gon' get this rain like it's May weather
G.O.O.D. Music, 'Ye weather
Champagne just tastes better
They told me I never, boy, never say never
Swear flow special like an infant's first steps
I got paid then reversed debts
Then I finally found a girl that reverse stress
So now I'm talkin' to the reaper to reverse death
Yep, so I can kick it with my granddad, take him for a ride
Show him I made somethin' out myself and not just tried
Show him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside
No matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind in my mind
But fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I said fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I grew up to Em, B.I.G., and Pac, bitch, and got ruined
So until I got the same crib B.I.G. had in that "Juicy" vid
Bitch, I can't motherfuckin' stop movin'
Go against me, you won't stop losin'
From the city where every month is May-Day at home, spray your dome
Niggas get sprayed up like A.K. was cologne for a paycheck or loan
Yeah, I know that shit ain't fair
They say Detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor
You write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone
I knew the world was for the taking and wouldn't take long
We on, tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody
Rep Detroit, everybody, Detroit vers' everybody
I'm so fuckin' first class I could spit up on every pilot
The city's my Metropolis, feel it, it's metabolic
And I'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest niggas
Then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot
I'm one of the hottest because I flame drop
Drop fire, and not because I'm namedroppin', Hall of Fame droppin'
And I ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're OGs
‘Cause that ain't the way of a OG
So I G-O collect mo' Gs, every dollar
Never changed though, I'm just the new version of old me
Forever hot-headed but never got cold feet
Got up in the game, won't look back at my old seats
Clique so deep we take up the whole street
I need a bitch so bad that she take up my whole week
Sean Don
Miscellaneous minds are never explainin' their minds
Devilish grin for my alias aliens to respond
Peddlin' sin, thinkin' maybe when you get old you realize
I'm not gonna fold or demise
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
Bitch, everything I rap is a quarter piece to your melon
So if you have a relapse, just relax and pop in my disc
Don't you pop me no fuckin' pill
I'ma pop you, then give you this

Tell Flex to drop a bomb on this shit
So many bombs, ring the alarm, like Vietnam on this shit
So many bombs, make Farrakhan think that Saddam in this bitch
One at a time, I line them up
And bomb on they mom while she watchin' the kids
I'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
I'm important like the Pope, I'm a Muslim on pork
I'm Makaveli's offspring, I'm the King of New York
King of the Coast; one hand, I juggle 'em both
The juggernaut's all in your jugular, you take me for jokes
Live in the basement, church pews, and funeral faces
Cartier bracelets for my women friends, I'm in Vegas
Who the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be?
If Phil Jackson came back, still no coachin' me
I'm uncoachable, I'm unsociable, fuck y'all clubs!
Fuck y'all pictures! Your Instagram can gobble these nuts!
Gobble dick up 'til you hiccup, my big homie Kurupt
This the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch
(West, West, West, West, West, West)
I've seen niggas transform like villain Decepticons
Mollies probably turn these niggas to fuckin' Lindsay Lohan
A bunch of rich-ass white girls lookin' for parties
Playin' with Barbies
Wreck the Porsche before you give them the car key
Judgement to the monarchy, blessings to Paul McCartney
You called me a black Beatle, I'm either that or a Marley
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
I'm dressed in all black, this is not for the fan of Elvis
I'm aimin' straight for your pelvis
You can't stomach me? You plan on stumpin' me?
Bitch, I’ve been jumped before you put a gun on me
Bitch, I put one on yours, I'm Sean Connery
James Bonding with none of you niggas
Climbin' 100 mil in front of me
And I'm gonna get it even if you're in the way
And if you're in it, better run for Pete's sake
I heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time
'Bout who's the best MC: Kendrick, Jigga, and Nas
Eminem, André 3000; the rest of y'all
New niggas just new niggas, don't get involved
And I ain't rockin' no more designer shit
White T’s and Nike Cortez, this red Corvette's anonymous
I'm usually homeboys with the same niggas I'm rhymin' with
But this is hip-hop, and them niggas should know what time it is
And that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big K.R.I.T., Wale
Pusha T, Meek Millz, A$AP Rocky, Drake
Big Sean, Jay Electron', Tyler, Mac Miller
I got love for you all, but I'm tryna murder you niggas
Tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
They don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
What is competition? I'm tryna raise the bar high
Who tryna jump and get it? You're better off tryna skydive
Out the exit window of five G5's with five grand
With your granddad as the pilot, he drunk as fuck, tryna land
With the hand full of arthritis and poppin' prosthetic leg
Bumpin' Pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head
Is an option of violence, someone heard the stewardess said
That your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread
West Coast
You could check my name on the books
I Earth Wind & Fire’d the verse, then reigned on the hook
The legend of Dorothy Flowers proclaimed from the roof
The tale of a magnificent king who came from the nooks
Of the wild magnolia, mother of many soldiers
We live by every single word she ever told us
Watch over your shoulders
And keep a tin of beans for when the weather turn the coldest
The Lord is our shepherd, so our cup runneth over
Put your trust in the Lord, but tether your Chevy Nova
I’m spittin' this shit for closure
And God is my witness, so you could get it from Hova
To all you magicians that’s fidgetin' with the cobra
I’m solid as a rock, ‘cause I came from a rock
That’s why I came with the rock
Then signed my name on the Roc
Draw a line around some Earth, then put my name on the plot
‘Cause I endured a lot of pain for everythang that I got
The eyelashes like umbrellas when it rain from the heart
And the tissue is like an angel kissin' you in the dark
You go from blind sight to hindsight
Passion of the Christ, right, to baskin' in the limelight
It take time to get your mind right
Jay Electricity, PBS Mysteries
In a lofty place tanglin' with Satan over history
You can’t say shit to me, الحمد لله‎
It’s strictly by faith that we made it this far624Embed

Father Stretch My Hands, Pt. 1 Lyrics
You're the only power (Power)
You're the only power that can
You're the only power (Power)
You're the only power that can
Oh, oh, oh, father
(If young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you)

Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe
Who can I turn to?
Nothin' unwanted
After all, who can I turn to?
Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe
If I don't turn to you
Nothin' unwanted
No other help I know, I stretch my hands
I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na
Who can I turn to?
I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na
After all, who can I turn to?
If I ever instigated, I am sorry
If I don't turn to you
Tell me who in here could relate, I-I-I
No other help I know, I stretch my hands

Now, if I fuck this model
And she just bleached her asshole
And I get bleach on my T-shirt
I'ma feel like an asshole
I was high when I met her
We was down in Tribeca
She'll get under your skin if you let her
She'll get under your skin if you— (Uh)
I don't even wanna talk about it
I don't even wanna talk about it
I don't even wanna say nothin'
Everybody gon' say somethin'
I'd be worried if they said nothin'
Remind me where I know you from
She lookin' like she owe you somethin'
You know just what we want
I wanna wake up with you in my—
Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe
Who can I turn to?
Beautiful mornin'
Nothin' unwanted
After all, who can I turn to?
Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe
If I don't turn to you
Nothin' unwanted
No other help I know

I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na
Who can I turn to?
I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na
After all, who can I turn to?
If I ever instigated, I am sorry
If I don't turn to you
Tell me who in here could relate, I-I-I

The Monster Lyrics
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee!
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm—
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it 'cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great!
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
Straw into gold, chump, I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that!
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
(Get along with) Get along with the voices inside of my head
(You're tryin' to) You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
(And you think) And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin'
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

It’s Everyday Bro Lyrics
Yah
Y'all can't handle this
Y'all don't know what's about to happen, baby
(It's everyday bro, everyday)
Team 10
Los Angeles, Cali boy
But I'm from Ohio though, white boy

It's everyday, bro, with the Disney Channel flow
Five mil' on YouTube in six months, never done before
Passed all the competition, man, PewDiePie is next
Man, I'm poppin' all these checks, got the brand new Rolex
And it match the Lambo too, and I'm coming with the crew
This is Team 10, bitch, who the hell are flippin' you?
And you know I kick them out if they ain't with the crew
Yeah, I'm talking about you, you beggin' for attention
Talking shit on Twitter, too, but you still hit my phone last night
It was 4:52, and I got the text to prove
And all the recordings too, don't make me tell them the truth
And I just dropped some new merch, and it's selling like a god church
Ohio's where I'm from, we chew 'em like it's gum
We shooting with a gun, the tattoo just for fun
I Usain Bolt and run, catch me at game one
I cannot be outdone, Jake Paul is number one
It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
I said it's everyday bro!

You know it's Nick Crompton, and my collar stay poppin'
Yes, I can rap, and no, I'm not from Compton
England is my city
And if it weren't for Team 10, then the US would be shitty
I'll pass it to Chance, 'cause you know he stay litty

Two months ago, you didn't know my name
And now you want my fame?
Bitch I'm blowin' up, I'm only going up
Now I'm going off, I'm never fallin' off
Like Mag, who? Digi who? Who are you?
All these beefs, I just ran through, hit a milli' in a month
Where were you? Hatin' on me back in West Fake
Think you need to get your shit straight
Jakey brought me to the top, now we really poppin' off
Number one and number four, that's why these fans all at our door
It's lonely at the top, so we all going
We left Ohio, now the trio's all rollin'
It's Team 10, bitch
We back again, always first, never last
We the future, we'll see you in the past
It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
I said it's everyday bro!

Hold on, hold on, hold on (Espera)
Can we switch the language? (Ha, ya tú sabe')
We 'bout to hit it (Dale)

Sí, lo único que quiero es dinero
Trabajando en YouTube todo el día entero (Dale)
Viviendo en U.S.A, el sueño de cualquiera (Ha)
Enviando dólares a mi familia entera (Pasta)
Tenemos una persona por encima
Se llama Donald Trump y está en la cima
Desde aquí te cantamos, can I get my VISA?
Martinez Twins, representando España
Desde la pobreza a la fama

It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
I said it's everyday bro!
Yo, it's Tessa Brooks
The competition shook
These guys up on me
I got 'em with the hook
Lemme educate ya
And I ain't talking book
Panera is your home
So stop calling my phone
I'm flyin' like a drone
They buying like a loan
Yeah, I smell good
Is that your boy's cologne?

Is that your boy's cologne?
Started ballin', Quicken Loans
Now I'm in my flippin' zone
Yes, they all copy me, but
That's some shitty clones
Stay in all designer clothes
And they ask me what I make
I said, "It's ten with six zeros"
Always plug merch link in bio
And I will see you tomorrow 'cause
It's everyday bro

Back to Back Lyrics
Oh man
Oh man, oh man
Not again

Yeah
I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Woah—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith, playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean whoa, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one
I got the drink in me, going back to back
Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me, going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back

I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you saying, "Drizzy, tell 'em again!"
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you'd do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'

They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga (Six)1.3KEmbed

Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe Lyrics
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling

Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of his?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling

Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe

I'm tryin' to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me, then put me on stages
To me, that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling

Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe

Bitch, don't kill my vibe
You ain't heard the coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings, now, what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on the pedestal
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music

I say bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe

Ayy, K-Dot, get in the car, nigga!
Come on, we finna roll out!
Nigga, I got a pack of blacks and a beat CD
Get yo' freestyles ready!703Embed

Black Beatles Lyrics
Black Beatles in the city
Be back immediately to confiscate the moneys
(Ear Drummers)
Rae Sremm, Guwop, Mike WiLL!
I sent flowers, but you said you didn't receive 'em
But you said you didn't need 'em (Mike WiLL Made-It!)

That girl is a real crowd pleaser (Oh, yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (Know me)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (Ah)
Quick-release the cash, watch it fall slowly (Slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even (Get even)
Haters mad for whatever reason (Yeah, yeah)
Smoke in the air, binge drinking (Oh, oh)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (Remember)
Getting so gone I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
There is nothin' to explain
I'm a fuckin' black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal
Rockin' John Lennon lenses, like to see ‘em spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
Screamin', "Everybody's famous!"
Like clockwork, I blow it all
And get some more
Get you somebody that can do both
Black Beatles got the babes belly rollin'
She think she love me, I think she trollin'

That girl is a real crowd pleaser (Oh, yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (Know me)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (Ah)
Quick-release the cash, watch it fall slowly (Slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even (Get even)
Haters mad for whatever reason (Yeah, yeah)
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin' (Oh, oh)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (Remember)

Came in with two girls, look like strippers in their real clothes
A broke ho can only point me to a rich ho
A yellow bitch with green hair, a real weirdo
Black man, yellow Lamb', red light go
They seen that Guwop and them just came in through the side door
There's so much money on the floor we buyin' school clothes
Why you bring the money machine to the club for?
Pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo
I Eurostep past a hater like I'm Rondo
I upgrade your baby mama to a condo
Like Chapo servin' llello to the gringos
Black Beatle, club close when I say so
That girl is a real crowd pleaser (Oh, yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (Know me)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (Ah)
Quick-release the cash, watch it fall slowly (Slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even (Get even)
Haters mad for whatever reason (Yeah, yeah)
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin' (Oh, oh)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (Remember)

She's a good teaser, and we blowin' reefer
Your body like a work of art, baby
Don't fuck with me, I'll break your heart, baby
D&G on me, I got a lot of flavor
15 hundred on my feet, I'm tryna kill these haters
I had haters when I was broke, I'm rich, I still got haters
I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player
I wear leather Gucci jackets like it's still the 80s
I've been blowin' OG Kush, I feel a lil' sedated
I can't worry about a broke nigga or a hater
Black Beatle, bitch, me and Paul McCartney related

That girl is a real crowd pleaser (Oh, yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (Know me)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (Ah)
Quick-release the cash, watch it fall slowly (Slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even (Get even)
Haters mad for whatever reason (Yeah, yeah)
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin' (Oh, oh)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (Remember)223Embed

Control Lyrics

Mhm, I look up
Yeah, and I take my time, nigga
I'ma take my time, woah
Mhm, power moves only, nigga

Boy, I'm 'bout my business on business, I drink liquor on liquor
I had women on women: yeah, that's bunk-bed bitches
I've done lived more than an 80-year-old man still kickin'
‘Cause they live for some moments, and I live for a livin'
But this for the girls who barely let me get to first base
On some ground ball shit
‘Cause now I run my city on some town hall shit
They prayin' on my motherfuckin' downfall, bitch
Like a drought, but you gon' get this rain like it's May weather
G.O.O.D. Music, 'Ye weather
Champagne just tastes better
They told me I never, boy, never say never
Swear flow special like an infant's first steps
I got paid then reversed debts
Then I finally found a girl that reverse stress
So now I'm talkin' to the reaper to reverse death
Yep, so I can kick it with my granddad, take him for a ride
Show him I made somethin' out myself and not just tried
Show him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside
No matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind in my mind
But fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I said fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I grew up to Em, B.I.G., and Pac, bitch, and got ruined
So until I got the same crib B.I.G. had in that "Juicy" vid
Bitch, I can't motherfuckin' stop movin'
Go against me, you won't stop losin'
From the city where every month is May-Day at home, spray your dome
Niggas get sprayed up like A.K. was cologne for a paycheck or loan
Yeah, I know that shit ain't fair
They say Detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor
You write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone
I knew the world was for the taking and wouldn't take long
We on, tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody
Rep Detroit, everybody, Detroit vers' everybody
I'm so fuckin' first class I could spit up on every pilot
The city's my Metropolis, feel it, it's metabolic
And I'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest niggas
Then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot
I'm one of the hottest because I flame drop
Drop fire, and not because I'm namedroppin', Hall of Fame droppin'
And I ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're OGs
‘Cause that ain't the way of a OG
So I G-O collect mo' Gs, every dollar
Never changed though, I'm just the new version of old me
Forever hot-headed but never got cold feet
Got up in the game, won't look back at my old seats
Clique so deep we take up the whole street
I need a bitch so bad that she take up my whole week
Sean Don
Miscellaneous minds are never explainin' their minds
Devilish grin for my alias aliens to respond
Peddlin' sin, thinkin' maybe when you get old you realize
I'm not gonna fold or demise
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
Bitch, everything I rap is a quarter piece to your melon
So if you have a relapse, just relax and pop in my disc
Don't you pop me no fuckin' pill
I'ma pop you, then give you this

Tell Flex to drop a bomb on this shit
So many bombs, ring the alarm, like Vietnam on this shit
So many bombs, make Farrakhan think that Saddam in this bitch
One at a time, I line them up
And bomb on they mom while she watchin' the kids
I'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
I'm important like the Pope, I'm a Muslim on pork
I'm Makaveli's offspring, I'm the King of New York
King of the Coast; one hand, I juggle 'em both
The juggernaut's all in your jugular, you take me for jokes
Live in the basement, church pews, and funeral faces
Cartier bracelets for my women friends, I'm in Vegas
Who the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be?
If Phil Jackson came back, still no coachin' me
I'm uncoachable, I'm unsociable, fuck y'all clubs!
Fuck y'all pictures! Your Instagram can gobble these nuts!
Gobble dick up 'til you hiccup, my big homie Kurupt
This the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch
(West, West, West, West, West, West)
I've seen niggas transform like villain Decepticons
Mollies probably turn these niggas to fuckin' Lindsay Lohan
A bunch of rich-ass white girls lookin' for parties
Playin' with Barbies
Wreck the Porsche before you give them the car key
Judgement to the monarchy, blessings to Paul McCartney
You called me a black Beatle, I'm either that or a Marley
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
I'm dressed in all black, this is not for the fan of Elvis
I'm aimin' straight for your pelvis
You can't stomach me? You plan on stumpin' me?
Bitch, I’ve been jumped before you put a gun on me
Bitch, I put one on yours, I'm Sean Connery
James Bonding with none of you niggas
Climbin' 100 mil in front of me
And I'm gonna get it even if you're in the way
And if you're in it, better run for Pete's sake
I heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time
'Bout who's the best MC: Kendrick, Jigga, and Nas
Eminem, André 3000; the rest of y'all
New niggas just new niggas, don't get involved
And I ain't rockin' no more designer shit
White T’s and Nike Cortez, this red Corvette's anonymous
I'm usually homeboys with the same niggas I'm rhymin' with
But this is hip-hop, and them niggas should know what time it is
And that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big K.R.I.T., Wale
Pusha T, Meek Millz, A$AP Rocky, Drake
Big Sean, Jay Electron', Tyler, Mac Miller
I got love for you all, but I'm tryna murder you niggas
Tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
They don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
What is competition? I'm tryna raise the bar high
Who tryna jump and get it? You're better off tryna skydive
Out the exit window of five G5's with five grand
With your granddad as the pilot, he drunk as fuck, tryna land
With the hand full of arthritis and poppin' prosthetic leg
Bumpin' Pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head
Is an option of violence, someone heard the stewardess said
That your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread
West Coast
You could check my name on the books
I Earth Wind & Fire’d the verse, then reigned on the hook
The legend of Dorothy Flowers proclaimed from the roof
The tale of a magnificent king who came from the nooks
Of the wild magnolia, mother of many soldiers
We live by every single word she ever told us
Watch over your shoulders
And keep a tin of beans for when the weather turn the coldest
The Lord is our shepherd, so our cup runneth over
Put your trust in the Lord, but tether your Chevy Nova
I’m spittin' this shit for closure
And God is my witness, so you could get it from Hova
To all you magicians that’s fidgetin' with the cobra
I’m solid as a rock, ‘cause I came from a rock
That’s why I came with the rock
Then signed my name on the Roc
Draw a line around some Earth, then put my name on the plot
‘Cause I endured a lot of pain for everythang that I got
The eyelashes like umbrellas when it rain from the heart
And the tissue is like an angel kissin' you in the dark
You go from blind sight to hindsight
Passion of the Christ, right, to baskin' in the limelight
It take time to get your mind right
Jay Electricity, PBS Mysteries
In a lofty place tanglin' with Satan over history
You can’t say shit to me, الحمد لله‎
It’s strictly by faith that we made it this far624Embed

Father Stretch My Hands, Pt. 1 Lyrics
You're the only power (Power)
You're the only power that can
You're the only power (Power)
You're the only power that can
Oh, oh, oh, father
(If young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you)

Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe
Who can I turn to?
Nothin' unwanted
After all, who can I turn to?
Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe
If I don't turn to you
Nothin' unwanted
No other help I know, I stretch my hands
I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na
Who can I turn to?
I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na
After all, who can I turn to?
If I ever instigated, I am sorry
If I don't turn to you
Tell me who in here could relate, I-I-I
No other help I know, I stretch my hands

Now, if I fuck this model
And she just bleached her asshole
And I get bleach on my T-shirt
I'ma feel like an asshole
I was high when I met her
We was down in Tribeca
She'll get under your skin if you let her
She'll get under your skin if you— (Uh)
I don't even wanna talk about it
I don't even wanna talk about it
I don't even wanna say nothin'
Everybody gon' say somethin'
I'd be worried if they said nothin'
Remind me where I know you from
She lookin' like she owe you somethin'
You know just what we want
I wanna wake up with you in my—
Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe
Who can I turn to?
Beautiful mornin'
Nothin' unwanted
After all, who can I turn to?
Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe
If I don't turn to you
Nothin' unwanted
No other help I know

I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na
Who can I turn to?
I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na
After all, who can I turn to?
If I ever instigated, I am sorry
If I don't turn to you
Tell me who in here could relate, I-I-I
No other help I know, I stretch my hands286Embed

The Monster Lyrics
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee!
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm—
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it 'cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great!
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
Straw into gold, chump, I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that!
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
(Get along with) Get along with the voices inside of my head
(You're tryin' to) You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
(And you think) And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin'
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Monster Lyrics
I shoot the lights out
Hide 'til it's bright out
Oh, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good bloodsucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles, all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example

Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands
Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit
I heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga, but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, "This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now"
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it "Malibooyah"
Goddamn, Yeezy always hit 'em with a new style
Know that motherfucker, well, what you gon' do now?
Whatever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So, mami, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ah, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm livin' in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert (Yeah)
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question, what do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfuckin' monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill a block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and bloodsuckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Millin' about, spillin' they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands
Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah, I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king, but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfuckin' monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wine it
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give an F-U-C-K
"Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, sh-she's fake"
"She on a diet," but my pockets eatin' cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am' should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Ah, I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home (Headed home)
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide (No)
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home (Head home)
I, I crossed the limelight (No, the limelight)
And I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home

It’s Everyday Bro Lyrics
Yah
Y'all can't handle this
Y'all don't know what's about to happen, baby
(It's everyday bro, everyday)
Team 10
Los Angeles, Cali boy
But I'm from Ohio though, white boy

It's everyday, bro, with the Disney Channel flow
Five mil' on YouTube in six months, never done before
Passed all the competition, man, PewDiePie is next
Man, I'm poppin' all these checks, got the brand new Rolex
And it match the Lambo too, and I'm coming with the crew
This is Team 10, bitch, who the hell are flippin' you?
And you know I kick them out if they ain't with the crew
Yeah, I'm talking about you, you beggin' for attention
Talking shit on Twitter, too, but you still hit my phone last night
It was 4:52, and I got the text to prove
And all the recordings too, don't make me tell them the truth
And I just dropped some new merch, and it's selling like a god church
Ohio's where I'm from, we chew 'em like it's gum
We shooting with a gun, the tattoo just for fun
I Usain Bolt and run, catch me at game one
I cannot be outdone, Jake Paul is number one
It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
I said it's everyday bro!

You know it's Nick Crompton, and my collar stay poppin'
Yes, I can rap, and no, I'm not from Compton
England is my city
And if it weren't for Team 10, then the US would be shitty
I'll pass it to Chance, 'cause you know he stay litty

Two months ago, you didn't know my name
And now you want my fame?
Bitch I'm blowin' up, I'm only going up
Now I'm going off, I'm never fallin' off
Like Mag, who? Digi who? Who are you?
All these beefs, I just ran through, hit a milli' in a month
Where were you? Hatin' on me back in West Fake
Think you need to get your shit straight
Jakey brought me to the top, now we really poppin' off
Number one and number four, that's why these fans all at our door
It's lonely at the top, so we all going
We left Ohio, now the trio's all rollin'
It's Team 10, bitch
We back again, always first, never last
We the future, we'll see you in the past
It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
I said it's everyday bro!

Hold on, hold on, hold on (Espera)
Can we switch the language? (Ha, ya tú sabe')
We 'bout to hit it (Dale)

Sí, lo único que quiero es dinero
Trabajando en YouTube todo el día entero (Dale)
Viviendo en U.S.A, el sueño de cualquiera (Ha)
Enviando dólares a mi familia entera (Pasta)
Tenemos una persona por encima
Se llama Donald Trump y está en la cima
Desde aquí te cantamos, can I get my VISA?
Martinez Twins, representando España
Desde la pobreza a la fama

It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
I said it's everyday bro!
Yo, it's Tessa Brooks
The competition shook
These guys up on me
I got 'em with the hook
Lemme educate ya
And I ain't talking book
Panera is your home
So stop calling my phone
I'm flyin' like a drone
They buying like a loan
Yeah, I smell good
Is that your boy's cologne?

Is that your boy's cologne?
Started ballin', Quicken Loans
Now I'm in my flippin' zone
Yes, they all copy me, but
That's some shitty clones
Stay in all designer clothes
And they ask me what I make
I said, "It's ten with six zeros"
Always plug merch link in bio
And I will see you tomorrow 'cause
It's everyday bro

Back to Back Lyrics
Oh man
Oh man, oh man
Not again

Yeah
I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Woah—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith, playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean whoa, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one
I got the drink in me, going back to back
Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me, going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back

I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you saying, "Drizzy, tell 'em again!"
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you'd do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'

They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga (Six)1.3KEmbed

Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe Lyrics
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling

Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of his?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling

Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe

I'm tryin' to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me, then put me on stages
To me, that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling

Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe

Bitch, don't kill my vibe
You ain't heard the coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings, now, what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on the pedestal
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music

I say bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe

Ayy, K-Dot, get in the car, nigga!
Come on, we finna roll out!
Nigga, I got a pack of blacks and a beat CD
Get yo' freestyles ready!703Embed

Black Beatles Lyrics
Black Beatles in the city
Be back immediately to confiscate the moneys
(Ear Drummers)
Rae Sremm, Guwop, Mike WiLL!
I sent flowers, but you said you didn't receive 'em
But you said you didn't need 'em (Mike WiLL Made-It!)

That girl is a real crowd pleaser (Oh, yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (Know me)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (Ah)
Quick-release the cash, watch it fall slowly (Slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even (Get even)
Haters mad for whatever reason (Yeah, yeah)
Smoke in the air, binge drinking (Oh, oh)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (Remember)
Getting so gone I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
There is nothin' to explain
I'm a fuckin' black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal
Rockin' John Lennon lenses, like to see ‘em spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
Screamin', "Everybody's famous!"
Like clockwork, I blow it all
And get some more
Get you somebody that can do both
Black Beatles got the babes belly rollin'
She think she love me, I think she trollin'

That girl is a real crowd pleaser (Oh, yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (Know me)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (Ah)
Quick-release the cash, watch it fall slowly (Slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even (Get even)
Haters mad for whatever reason (Yeah, yeah)
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin' (Oh, oh)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (Remember)

Came in with two girls, look like strippers in their real clothes
A broke ho can only point me to a rich ho
A yellow bitch with green hair, a real weirdo
Black man, yellow Lamb', red light go
They seen that Guwop and them just came in through the side door
There's so much money on the floor we buyin' school clothes
Why you bring the money machine to the club for?
Pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo
I Eurostep past a hater like I'm Rondo
I upgrade your baby mama to a condo
Like Chapo servin' llello to the gringos
Black Beatle, club close when I say so
That girl is a real crowd pleaser (Oh, yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (Know me)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (Ah)
Quick-release the cash, watch it fall slowly (Slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even (Get even)
Haters mad for whatever reason (Yeah, yeah)
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin' (Oh, oh)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (Remember)

She's a good teaser, and we blowin' reefer
Your body like a work of art, baby
Don't fuck with me, I'll break your heart, baby
D&G on me, I got a lot of flavor
15 hundred on my feet, I'm tryna kill these haters
I had haters when I was broke, I'm rich, I still got haters
I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player
I wear leather Gucci jackets like it's still the 80s
I've been blowin' OG Kush, I feel a lil' sedated
I can't worry about a broke nigga or a hater
Black Beatle, bitch, me and Paul McCartney related

That girl is a real crowd pleaser (Oh, yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (Know me)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (Ah)
Quick-release the cash, watch it fall slowly (Slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even (Get even)
Haters mad for whatever reason (Yeah, yeah)
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin' (Oh, oh)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (Remember)223Embed

Control Lyrics

Mhm, I look up
Yeah, and I take my time, nigga
I'ma take my time, woah
Mhm, power moves only, nigga

Boy, I'm 'bout my business on business, I drink liquor on liquor
I had women on women: yeah, that's bunk-bed bitches
I've done lived more than an 80-year-old man still kickin'
‘Cause they live for some moments, and I live for a livin'
But this for the girls who barely let me get to first base
On some ground ball shit
‘Cause now I run my city on some town hall shit
They prayin' on my motherfuckin' downfall, bitch
Like a drought, but you gon' get this rain like it's May weather
G.O.O.D. Music, 'Ye weather
Champagne just tastes better
They told me I never, boy, never say never
Swear flow special like an infant's first steps
I got paid then reversed debts
Then I finally found a girl that reverse stress
So now I'm talkin' to the reaper to reverse death
Yep, so I can kick it with my granddad, take him for a ride
Show him I made somethin' out myself and not just tried
Show him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside
No matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind in my mind
But fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I said fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I grew up to Em, B.I.G., and Pac, bitch, and got ruined
So until I got the same crib B.I.G. had in that "Juicy" vid
Bitch, I can't motherfuckin' stop movin'
Go against me, you won't stop losin'
From the city where every month is May-Day at home, spray your dome
Niggas get sprayed up like A.K. was cologne for a paycheck or loan
Yeah, I know that shit ain't fair
They say Detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor
You write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone
I knew the world was for the taking and wouldn't take long
We on, tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody
Rep Detroit, everybody, Detroit vers' everybody
I'm so fuckin' first class I could spit up on every pilot
The city's my Metropolis, feel it, it's metabolic
And I'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest niggas
Then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot
I'm one of the hottest because I flame drop
Drop fire, and not because I'm namedroppin', Hall of Fame droppin'
And I ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're OGs
‘Cause that ain't the way of a OG
So I G-O collect mo' Gs, every dollar
Never changed though, I'm just the new version of old me
Forever hot-headed but never got cold feet
Got up in the game, won't look back at my old seats
Clique so deep we take up the whole street
I need a bitch so bad that she take up my whole week
Sean Don
Miscellaneous minds are never explainin' their minds
Devilish grin for my alias aliens to respond
Peddlin' sin, thinkin' maybe when you get old you realize
I'm not gonna fold or demise
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
Bitch, everything I rap is a quarter piece to your melon
So if you have a relapse, just relax and pop in my disc
Don't you pop me no fuckin' pill
I'ma pop you, then give you this

Tell Flex to drop a bomb on this shit
So many bombs, ring the alarm, like Vietnam on this shit
So many bombs, make Farrakhan think that Saddam in this bitch
One at a time, I line them up
And bomb on they mom while she watchin' the kids
I'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
I'm important like the Pope, I'm a Muslim on pork
I'm Makaveli's offspring, I'm the King of New York
King of the Coast; one hand, I juggle 'em both
The juggernaut's all in your jugular, you take me for jokes
Live in the basement, church pews, and funeral faces
Cartier bracelets for my women friends, I'm in Vegas
Who the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be?
If Phil Jackson came back, still no coachin' me
I'm uncoachable, I'm unsociable, fuck y'all clubs!
Fuck y'all pictures! Your Instagram can gobble these nuts!
Gobble dick up 'til you hiccup, my big homie Kurupt
This the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch
(West, West, West, West, West, West)
I've seen niggas transform like villain Decepticons
Mollies probably turn these niggas to fuckin' Lindsay Lohan
A bunch of rich-ass white girls lookin' for parties
Playin' with Barbies
Wreck the Porsche before you give them the car key
Judgement to the monarchy, blessings to Paul McCartney
You called me a black Beatle, I'm either that or a Marley
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
I'm dressed in all black, this is not for the fan of Elvis
I'm aimin' straight for your pelvis
You can't stomach me? You plan on stumpin' me?
Bitch, I’ve been jumped before you put a gun on me
Bitch, I put one on yours, I'm Sean Connery
James Bonding with none of you niggas
Climbin' 100 mil in front of me
And I'm gonna get it even if you're in the way
And if you're in it, better run for Pete's sake
I heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time
'Bout who's the best MC: Kendrick, Jigga, and Nas
Eminem, André 3000; the rest of y'all
New niggas just new niggas, don't get involved
And I ain't rockin' no more designer shit
White T’s and Nike Cortez, this red Corvette's anonymous
I'm usually homeboys with the same niggas I'm rhymin' with
But this is hip-hop, and them niggas should know what time it is
And that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big K.R.I.T., Wale
Pusha T, Meek Millz, A$AP Rocky, Drake
Big Sean, Jay Electron', Tyler, Mac Miller
I got love for you all, but I'm tryna murder you niggas
Tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
They don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
What is competition? I'm tryna raise the bar high
Who tryna jump and get it? You're better off tryna skydive
Out the exit window of five G5's with five grand
With your granddad as the pilot, he drunk as fuck, tryna land
With the hand full of arthritis and poppin' prosthetic leg
Bumpin' Pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head
Is an option of violence, someone heard the stewardess said
That your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread
West Coast
You could check my name on the books
I Earth Wind & Fire’d the verse, then reigned on the hook
The legend of Dorothy Flowers proclaimed from the roof
The tale of a magnificent king who came from the nooks
Of the wild magnolia, mother of many soldiers
We live by every single word she ever told us
Watch over your shoulders
And keep a tin of beans for when the weather turn the coldest
The Lord is our shepherd, so our cup runneth over
Put your trust in the Lord, but tether your Chevy Nova
I’m spittin' this shit for closure
And God is my witness, so you could get it from Hova
To all you magicians that’s fidgetin' with the cobra
I’m solid as a rock, ‘cause I came from a rock
That’s why I came with the rock
Then signed my name on the Roc
Draw a line around some Earth, then put my name on the plot
‘Cause I endured a lot of pain for everythang that I got
The eyelashes like umbrellas when it rain from the heart
And the tissue is like an angel kissin' you in the dark
You go from blind sight to hindsight
Passion of the Christ, right, to baskin' in the limelight
It take time to get your mind right
Jay Electricity, PBS Mysteries
In a lofty place tanglin' with Satan over history
You can’t say shit to me, الحمد لله‎
It’s strictly by faith that we made it this far624Embed

Father Stretch My Hands, Pt. 1 Lyrics
You're the only power (Power)
You're the only power that can
You're the only power (Power)
You're the only power that can
Oh, oh, oh, father
(If young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you)

Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe
Who can I turn to?
Nothin' unwanted
After all, who can I turn to?
Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe
If I don't turn to you
Nothin' unwanted
No other help I know, I stretch my hands
I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na
Who can I turn to?
I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na
After all, who can I turn to?
If I ever instigated, I am sorry
If I don't turn to you
Tell me who in here could relate, I-I-I
No other help I know, I stretch my hands

Now, if I fuck this model
And she just bleached her asshole
And I get bleach on my T-shirt
I'ma feel like an asshole
I was high when I met her
We was down in Tribeca
She'll get under your skin if you let her
She'll get under your skin if you— (Uh)
I don't even wanna talk about it
I don't even wanna talk about it
I don't even wanna say nothin'
Everybody gon' say somethin'
I'd be worried if they said nothin'
Remind me where I know you from
She lookin' like she owe you somethin'
You know just what we want
I wanna wake up with you in my—
Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe
Who can I turn to?
Beautiful mornin'
Nothin' unwanted
After all, who can I turn to?
Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe
If I don't turn to you
Nothin' unwanted
No other help I know

I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na
Who can I turn to?
I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na
After all, who can I turn to?
If I ever instigated, I am sorry
If I don't turn to you
Tell me who in here could relate, I-I-I
No other help I know, I stretch my hands286Embed

The Monster Lyrics
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee!
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm—
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it 'cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great!
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
Straw into gold, chump, I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that!
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
(Get along with) Get along with the voices inside of my head
(You're tryin' to) You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
(And you think) And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin'
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Monster Lyrics
I shoot the lights out
Hide 'til it's bright out
Oh, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good bloodsucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles, all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example

Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands
Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit
I heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga, but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, "This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now"
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it "Malibooyah"
Goddamn, Yeezy always hit 'em with a new style
Know that motherfucker, well, what you gon' do now?
Whatever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So, mami, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ah, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm livin' in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert (Yeah)
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question, what do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfuckin' monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill a block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and bloodsuckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Millin' about, spillin' they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands
Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah, I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king, but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfuckin' monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wine it
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give an F-U-C-K
"Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, sh-she's fake"
"She on a diet," but my pockets eatin' cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am' should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Ah, I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home (Headed home)
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide (No)
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home (Head home)
I, I crossed the limelight (No, the limelight)
And I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home

Lucid Dreams Lyrics
Enviyon on the mix
No, no, no, no
No-no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (Were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up in your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?)
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
Easier said than done, I thought you were—
—instead of my head
You found another— better one
I won't let you forget me505Embed

Thrift Shop Lyrics
"Hey, Macklemore, can we go thrift shopping?"
What what, what, what
What what, what, what
What what, what, what
What what, what, what
What what, what, what
Bada, bada, bada doo da
What what, what, what
Bada, bada, bada doo da

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome

Now
Walk into the club like, "What up? I got a big cock"
Nah, I'm just pumped, I bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
The people like, "Damn, that's a cold ass honkey"
Rollin' in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink 'cept my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standin' next to me
Probably should've washed this, smells like R. Kelly sheets
Piss...
But shit, it was ninety-nine cents! (Bag it)
Coppin' it, washin' it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passin' up on those moccasins someone else has been walkin' in
Bummy and grungy, fuck it man, I am stunting and flossin'
And saving my money and I'm hella happy; that’s a bargain, bitch
I'ma take your grandpa's style, I'ma take your grandpa's style
No, for real, ask your grandpa, can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you!)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found diggin'
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my mellow
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make 'em cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like, "Ah, he got the Velcros"
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome

What you know about rockin' a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowin' about wearin' a fur fox skin?
I'm diggin', I'm diggin', I'm searchin' right through that luggage
One man's trash, that's another man's come up
Thank your granddad for donatin' that plaid button-
Up shirt 'cause right now, I'm up in her skirt
I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the bins
I'm not, I'm not stuck on searchin' in that section (Mens)
Your grammy, your auntie, your mama, your mammy
I'll take those flannel zebra jammies second hand and I'll rock that, motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on the motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like, "Oh, that Gucci? That's hella tight"
I'm like, "Yo, that's fifty dollars for a T-shirt"
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
Fifty dollars for a T-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting-swindled-and-pimped shit
I call that getting tricked by business
That shirt's hella though
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Tryna get girls from a brand?
Man, you hella won't! Man, you hella won't!
Goodwill, poppin' tags, yeah!

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome

I'll wear your granddad's clothes
I look incredible
I'm in this big-ass coat
From that thrift shop down the road
I'll wear your granddad's clothes (Damn right)
I look incredible (Now come on, man)
I’m in this big-ass coat (Big-ass coat)
From that thrift shop down the road (Let's go, come on!)

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome

​iSpy Lyrics
Man, fuck
What's wrong Kyle?
Man, these kids, man, talkin' shit, makin' me feel bad
Man, fuck them kids, bro! Look around, bro, look at life
Man, you're right
Mmm, you see, you see these fine bitches over here?
Yeah, woah...
You see these trees man? You see this water?
I guess it is okay
Come on, man, you got so much more to appreciate, man
Man you know what, y-you're right…
You damn right I'm right, I can't remember a time I was god-damn wrong
Man, thanks, Lil Boat
Hey man, that's what I'm here for
I ain't been gettin' high
Well, maybe a little, baby, I don't wanna lie
I know when you text me, girl, I don't always reply
Well you're not an angel either, you can't even fly (Yeah)
I noticed, you think that you know shit (Why you know?)
All this shade that's comin' at me, I wonder who throws it (Throws it)
They can't see the vision, boy they must be out of focus (Out of focus)
That's a real hot album homie, I wonder who wrote it, oh shit (Woo!)
Otay, pray them niggas go away (Go away)
Always hella clowns around, it look like Cirque Du Soleil (Soleil)
This is not the album either, these are just the throwaways
This shit still so cold when it drop, it's gonna be a mothafuckin' snow day
Ayy, boy is good and he knows it (Yup), he don't say it, he shows it (Yup)
I'm just like DeRozan (Yup), if I shoot it, it goes in
I'm in Cali just coastin' (Yup), get 'em so wet they need coasters (Facts)
I got a selfie with Oprah (Facts), I just ain't never post it
And I'm in my happy place posted
I ain't frowned since '06, I ain't cried since '01
My pad like Six Flags and your house is no fun
You can come back to mine though
Your friend ain't cute, but it's fine though
We gon' end on a high note

I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I

She said she 21, I might have to ID that
All my bitches come in pairs like balls in my nutsack
I remember ridin' around the city in a Hatchback
Lookin' for a problem with my young goblins
I'ma send a model home with her neck throbbin'
I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin'
Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Woah, six months later, I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from "Can you take me here?" to screenin' out the lane
Went from "Damn, this nigga lame" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college, now all them niggas is history
I upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Ridin' deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy?)
So don't fuck with me
No, lately I been livin' like luxury
Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys
And on my mother's mother
I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I210Embed

FEFE Lyrics
It's fuckin' TR3YWAY!
King of New York, lookin' for the Queen
Uh, you got the right one, hmm
L-let these-l-let these b-b-bitches know, nigga
Queens, Brooklyn, brrr, ah!
Murda on the beat so it's not nice!

Pussy got that wet, wet, got that drip, drip
Got that super soaker, hit that
She a Fefe, her name Keke
She eat my dick like it's free, free
I don't even know like "Why I did that?"
I don't even know like "Why I hit that?"
All I know is that I just can't wife that
Talk to her nice so she won't fight back
Turn around and hit it from the back, back, back
Bend her down then I make it clap, clap, clap
I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no

Draco got that kick-back when I blow that, they all do track
They don't shoot back, one shot, close range, red dot
Head tight, yeah, I did that, yeah, I live that
Call a Uber with my shooter, with a Ruger, we gon' do ya
Niggas say they killin' people, but I really fuckin' do it

I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no

He-he tryna 69 like Tekashi, call him papi
Word to A$AP, keep me Rocky, I'm from New York, so I'm cocky
Say he fuckin' with my posse, copped me Khloé like Kardashi'
Keep this pussy in Versace, said I'm pretty like Tinashe
Put-put it all up in his face, did I catch a case?
Pussy game just caught a body, but I never leave a trace
Face is pretty, ass for days, I get chips, I ask for Lay's
I just sit back and when he done, I be like, "Yo, how'd it taste?"
(Yo, how'd it taste?)
I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no

Ayo, Draco got that kick-back
When it kick-back, you can't get yo shit back
In fact this that bitch that
"I hate small talk, I don't fuck with chit-chat"
AC just stopped workin'
So they hit me, told me bring my wrist back
Come through rockin' fashions
That got all these bitches like "Yo, what's that?"
(Like "Yo, what's that?")

I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no

Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
I catch a ho right by her toe
If she ain't fuckin' me and Nicki
Kick that ho right through the door (TR3YWAY)
I don't really want no friends, my old ho just bought this Benz
Nicki just hopped in this shit, now I won't see that bitch again
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe (no)
I catch a ho right by her toe (no)
If she ain't fuckin' me and Nicki
Kick that ho right through the door (no, TR3YWAY)
Mmm, Young Money, Young Money bunny
Colorful hair, don't care
I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no
I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no

Lucky You Lyrics
Woah, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it, then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food (Yeah)
Pass the plate (Yeah), where my drink (Hol' up)?
This my day (Yeah, yeah), lucky you, fuck you too, woo!

Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room (Woo!), give me some room (Hey!), give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move (Boom, bap), y'all gotta move (Woo!), give me the juice
Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished (Bap, bop, bop)
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin' (Yuh)
You might'a went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys (Woo!)
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time (Yeah!)
I ain't no gangster, but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My Twelve Days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (I)
Run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo!)
I live on Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo!)
Bitch, I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw four like a Uno (Bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón
Little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've embedded the level, I been the ghetto to ghetto
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now (Yeah, yeah)
Shit get realer, but 'til all the beef die down (Yeah)
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down (Bop, bop)
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shawty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now (Woo! Woo!)
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab, down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo! Woo!)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way (Yeah), I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em (Ah)
Wasn't in it for the trophies (Nah), just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference? I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me, fuck you think? (Woo!)

I got a couple of mansions
Still, I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghostwriters
But to these kids, it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, "What the fuck happened to hip-hop?"
I said, "I don't have any answers"
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell, but I'm back on these rappers (Yeah)
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, "What a wonderful feeling!
We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!"
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta, ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap (Yeah)
Let's recap, way back, MC's that (What?)
Wreak havoc on tape decks (Woo)
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap (Nah), and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact (Yeah), where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable they know what button to press
Or what lever to pull to give me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention, I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya dicks and I'm fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again, as I begin to thinkin' about an evil intent of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eating a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least seventy or three-hundred milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker (Yeah)
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA (Yeah)
But I roll 'til the wheels fall off, I'm working tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for like California
Wishin' rain to pour in that drought, y'all
Been prayin' for my downfall (Yeah)
From the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy
So y'all gotta move, yeah, y'all gotta move, yeah, y'all gotta move
Give me some room (Woo!), give me some room (Hey!), give me the juice
Hop out the coupe (Joyner!), hop out the coupe (Joyner!), hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move (Boom, bap), y'all gotta move (Woo!), give me the juice792Embed

King Kunta Lyrics
I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers
Sittin' in my throne again
Ayy, ayy, nigga, what's happenin'?
K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
I'm mad (He mad!), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question

Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller (Oh yeah!)

Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
Twenty-four-seven, three-sixty-five days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' off stage
Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say… (Oh yeah)
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', "Compton!"
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin', "Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?"
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'—*Gunshot*
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—*Gunshot*
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk
We want the funk
We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?
We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?
We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?
We want the funk
Do you want the funk?
We want the funk
Do you want the funk?
We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?
We want the funk

I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence2KEmbed

Poetic Justice Lyrics
Every second, every minute
Man, I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now
Put me in the mood
I'm talkin' about dark room, perfume, go, go

I recognize your fragrance
Hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit
Uh, and I know your taste is
A little bit, hmm, high maintenance
Uh, everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends
And y'all curled in that little bitty Range
I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs
'Less I write it down for real, P.S
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
I really hope you play this, 'cause ol' girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs
And all these one-off vacations you've been takin'
Clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin
And your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move
I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
Unless I write 'em down for real, P.S
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it? I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe
Call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it
Uh-huh, that's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, P.S
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
"I'm gon' ask you one more time, homie
Where is you from? Or it is a problem."
"Ayy, you over here for Sherane, homie?"
"Yo, I don't care who this nigga over here for
If he don't tell me where he from, it's a wrap! I'm sorry."
"Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we gon' do it like this, okay?
I'ma tell you where I'm from, okay?
You gon' tell me where you from, okay?
Or where your grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, okay?"
"Enough with all this talkin'."
"Matter of fact, get out the van, homie! Get out the car before I snatch you out that motherfucker, homie!"412Embed

My crown won't fit on your bum-ass lace fronts (Uh)
You bitches catchin' a fade, shout out my nigga Lil Boosie
All of your friends'll be dead, you can get hit with that Uzi
I call him Ricky, he say he love me like Lucy
Get you a straw nigga, you know this pussy is juicy
This Givenchy is custom made, now you can't get it at Saks though
I don't work in no office, but they copyin' and that's facts though
I ain't tryna be violent, but if Nicki on it, it slaps, ho
Get you lined for that paper like a loose leaf when that strap blow
I'm with a couple bad bitches that'll rip the party
If Quavo the QB, I'm Nick Lombardi
Pull up in the space coupe, I done linked with Marty
I can actually afford to get a pink Bugatti
"Ayo, Nick, didn't you just do a hit with Gotti?"
That too, but my niggas send hits like Gotti
It's a wrap, like the things on the head of a Saudi
Bitch, you my son, go and sit on the potty (Rrrrrr)
Brand new Chanels (Chanels)
I scuffed 'em runnin' from 12 (12)
Ain't make no commitment with none of you bitches
'Cause money is treatin' me well (Uh-uh)
If Nicki should show me her titty
Right hand on the Bible, I swear I won't tell (Swear)
If I get to play with that kitty
I wonder how many platinums we gon' sell (Albums)
Pop a Perc and catch a feel (I pop one)
Now I cannot feel the wheel (Woah)
My chest bad, give me chills (Ice)
And the left hand on Richard Mille (Ice)
Not the watch, but the price on the ice
If you don't know what that is (Huh)
Motorsport, motorville
Abort the mission, that's a kill (Pew, pew, brrr)

Motorsport, yeah, put that thing in sport (Skrrt, skrrt)
Shawty bad (Bad), pop her like a cork (Pop it)
You a dork, never been a sport (Dork, yeah)
Pull up, woo, woo, jumpin' out the court (Jump)
Cotton candy (Drink), my cup tastes like the fair (Cotton)
Straight up there (Where?), we didn't take the stairs (Where?)
Faced my fears (My fears), gave my mama tears (Mama)
Shiftin' gears (Shift), on the Nawf, get serious (Serious)
